# Scorpion Editor

Note: This is a very early work-in-progress version of the Scorpion Editor for Windows. It isn't feature complete, is likely to have more than a handful of breaking bugs, and may not work on every Windows configuration - Windows 10 is the recommended OS. Updates will be released on an "early and often" basis.

The editor itself is not open source - but all of the included demos are.

Documentation needs to be redone, as do the other two demos (Phoenix Wright and Zelda ROTT)

Please report all bugs to the EAB thread: http://eab.abime.net/showthread.php?p=1357780, or email me directly at earok 3d at gmail dot com
