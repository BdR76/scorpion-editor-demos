# Scorpion Editor

Note: This is a very early work-in-progress version of the Scorpion Editor for Windows. It isn't feature complete, is likely to have more than a handful of breaking bugs, and may not work on every Windows configuration - Windows 10 is the recommended OS. Updates will be released on an "early and often" basis.

The editor itself is not open source - but all of the included demos are.

* Zelda: Return of the Hylian demo based on the games by Nintendo and the fan work by Vincent Jouillat. Includes tracker music by Coma28
* Ace Attorney demo based on the games by Capcom.
* Alex Kidd demo based on the games by Sega. Includes tracker music by JMD. 
* RepairWare demo ported from the game by Sergio Cornaga.
* Mario demo based on the games by Nintendo and the DOS fan game by Mike Wiering

Uses the Silk Icons pack - http://www.famfamfam.com/lab/icons/silk/ - as well as the application icons for FS-UAE, WinUAE and Backbone.

Documentation still needs to be done.
