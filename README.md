# Scorpion Editor

Note: This is a very early work-in-progress version of the Scorpion Editor for Windows. It isn't feature complete, is likely to have more than a handful of breaking bugs, and may not work on every Windows configuration - Windows 10 is the recommended OS. Updates will be released on an "early and often" basis.

Please report all bugs to the EAB thread: http://eab.abime.net/showthread.php?p=1357780, or email me directly at earok 3d at gmail dot com
